# Milestone 2
The Code is tested under Google Colab with both CPU and T4 environments, and we strongly recommend using Colab to run our code.

## Supervised learning

2. CNN Genre Classification
We recommand using T4 for this code.

3. RNN Genre Classification
Both CPU or T4 will take a super long time to train the model. We recommand using V100/A100 to train the model.

4. CNN Emotion Classificaton
We recommand using T4 for this notebook, as transformers are needed to generate the labels.

5. CNN Regresson with MIDI files
Both CPU and T4 works well for this notebook, while T4 is significantly faster.

6. CNN Regression with MP3 files
Both CPU and T4 works well for this notebook, while T4 is significantly faster.

## Unsupervised learning
GPU is not used in this notebook, so there's no need to use T4.
